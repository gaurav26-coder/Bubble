### Inspiration🤗
Feel struck and stagnated in the remote seclusion of your home due to the reigning pandemic? Missing the vibrant and ruckus of your social life? These are quite prominent concerns amongst people of all hues and climes these days. They have been raging our minds and as we pondered about quick solutions to revive the thrill of lively interactions in a technology-enabled fashion, an exciting idea struck us - why not build an application customized by us in order to meet the social cravings of the pro-social-media fans.
